Iteration 1: Create a Rails app to track promises that people make you. It should have full CRUD functionality for promises. These are not to be confused with JavaScript promisesðŸ˜‰

Iteration 2: Each promise should have a default status of `in progress`, but should be able to be updated to `abandoned` or `done`.
